# Pong Game in Python
You need to pass the ball to the sides without touching the wall. <br>
When the ball hits the left or right wall, i.e., when either of the user misses to push the ball back, the score is updated. <br>
Use 'Up' and 'Down' arrow keys to move right paddle and use 'w' and 's' to move left paddle.
