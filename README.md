# Pong - in Python
The classic Pong Game built using Python Turtle.
I have made use of OOP in Python to create this infamous pong game which was once the hype of gaming industry.
We create an object from a class for each component - Paddle, Ball, Score and Display Content.
When any user misses the ball, and it hits the wall, the direction of ball is reset and the color of display content - Text, Circle and Dashed Line changes randomly, with a blink effect.
Open the project in PyCharm(prefered IDE) and hit Run button.
