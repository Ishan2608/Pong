# Clone of Pong

Welcome to the Clone of Pong project! This GitHub repository hosts an exciting clone of the classic Pong game, built using Python and the Turtle library. With intuitive controls and smooth gameplay, this project is suitable for intermediate to advanced developers who want to challenge themselves with game development.

# Overview
Pong is a classic arcade game where two players control paddles and compete to hit a ball back and forth. The objective is to prevent the ball from touching the wall on your side, as each time the ball passes a player, the opponent earns a point. This clone of Pong replicates the original gameplay, allowing players to immerse themselves in the nostalgic experience.

# Technologies Used
The Clone of Pong project harnesses the following technologies:

- Python: The core language that powers the game logic and controls the flow of the application.

- Turtle Library: Used to create the game's graphical user interface, handle the animation, and control the paddles and ball movement.

# How to Play
To start playing the Clone of Pong:

- The left paddle is controlled by the 'w' (move up) and 's' (move down) keys.
- The right paddle is controlled by the up and down arrow keys.
- The objective is to hit the ball back and forth, preventing it from touching the walls on your side. Each time the ball passes a player, the opponent earns a point.



# Features
The Clone of Pong project comes packed with exciting features:

- Pause and Resume Game
At any point during the game, players can pause the action and take a break. The option to resume allows for a seamless gaming experience without losing progress.

- Score Tracking
Keep track of each player's scores throughout the game. The score is updated dynamically as players earn points, providing a competitive atmosphere.

- Updating Colors in UI
Customize the game's visual appearance with the ability to update colours in the user interface. Players can choose their preferred colour scheme to make the game uniquely theirs.
